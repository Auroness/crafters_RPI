# crafters_RPI
A RPI based on SOI, that focuses on crafting instead of fighting
This is a private project that will never be used for public access, due to licensing issues with original coders and copyright holders.
The game will simplify an RPI by remoivng combat and realted functions. The game itself will focus on crafting, and social interaction. Exploration may be added at a later date. 

I had some great ideas when I was working with SOI, but never got a chance to finsih them. This will be my chance to see if my ideas would really work, and just how much different the game would be, compared to the original SOI.
